## Project Overview
- **Objective**: Redesign and recreate Third Studio’s website with a focus on **modern Web3 design** and user-friendly interfaces.  
- **Process**:
  1. Research and analyze **Web3 design trends**  
  2. Build **low-fidelity wireframes** and define **user flows**  
  3. Design **high-fidelity prototypes** in Figma  
  4. Test with users, gather **feedback**, and iterate  
  5. Prepare final assets for **developer handoff**

## Research & Analysis (Weeks 1-2)

### Understanding Third Studio
- Examine **current website structure**, design language, and user flow  
- Identify **key UI elements**, visual aesthetics, and branding styles

### Web3 Design Trends Research
- Look into **gradient-heavy visuals**, **futuristic UI elements** (e.g., neon, cyberpunk styles), **3D animations**, and **dark mode**  
- Note **decentralized identity** and **Web3 interactions**  
- Compare competitor sites to spot **common trends** and **unique approaches**

### User Personas & Target Audience
- Define **user personas** (e.g., crypto investors, NFT creators, blockchain developers)  
- Map **user goals** and **pain points** for Web3 platforms  
- Address usability for **tech-savvy** and **non-tech-savvy** audiences

---

## Wireframing & UX Design (Weeks 3-4)

### Information Architecture & Navigation
- Outline **site structure**: Homepage, About, Services, Case Studies, Contact, Blog  
- Create a clear **hierarchy** of content for readability

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- Use Figma to sketch **basic page layouts** and **call-to-actions**  
- Validate wireframes against **usability heuristics**

### User Flow & Interaction Mapping
- Define the **ideal user journey** for each persona  
- Plan **micro-interactions** (e.g., hover effects) to enhance engagement

---

## UI Design & Prototyping (Weeks 5-6)

### High-Fidelity UI Designs
- Apply **Web3-inspired** color schemes and typography  
- Focus on **modern, bold, futuristic** visuals  
- Ensure layouts are **responsive** for mobile, tablet, and desktop

### Interactive Prototypes
- Implement **hover states, animations, transitions** in Figma  
- Conduct **peer reviews** to gather feedback  
- Refine prototypes for a **smooth, intuitive** user experience

---

## Feedback & Iteration (Week 7)

### Usability Testing
- Collect feedback from **peers** and **instructors**  
- Identify any **navigation** or **readability** issues

### Design Improvements
- Refine UI components for **visual consistency**  
- Improve **contrast** and **text legibility** for accessibility  
- Streamline interactions to **reduce user friction**

---

## Handoff & Documentation (Week 8)

### Preparing Developer Handoff
- Organize Figma layers with **clear naming conventions** and **auto-layout**  
- Generate **style guides**, component libraries, and typography standards

### Final Project Presentation
- Document all **research findings**, **design decisions**, and **iteration outcomes**  
- Present a **summary report** with key insights and final designs

---

## Conclusion
By completing this project, you will:
- Gain **practical experience** in Web3 UI/UX design principles  
- Develop a **portfolio-worthy** case study demonstrating the entire design process  
- Strengthen **Figma** proficiency and **user-centered design** skills
